# Creating a Collection

> _If you have an existing collection inside of another tool that you would like to import, please see [Importing Collections](https://docs.usebruno.com/get-started/import-export-data/import-collections)._

Create a collection by selecting `Create Collection` from the **home screen** or **top left corner** of the app.

In Bruno, a **collection** is a group of **API requests** or **test scenarios** that you can organize and manage.

A popup dialog will appear, asking you to name your collection and choose its location in the file system. You can also choose to edit the generated folder's name.

Select `Create` and ... Congratulations! You have successfully created your first collection into Bruno!

[Add a request](https://docs.usebruno.com/get-started/bruno-basics/create-a-request) to your collection as a next step!
