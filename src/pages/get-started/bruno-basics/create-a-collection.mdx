# Creating a Collection

<Callout type="info">
  If you have an existing collection inside of another tool that you would like to import, please see [Importing Collections <strong><sup>↗</sup></strong>](https://docs.usebruno.com/get-started/import-export-data/import-collections).
</Callout>

Create a collection by selecting `Create Collection` from the **home screen** or **top left corner** of the app.

In Bruno, a **collection** is a group of **API requests** or **test scenarios** that you can organize and manage.

A popup dialog will appear, asking you to name your collection and choose its location in the file system. You can also choose to edit the generated folder's name.

Select `Create` and ... Congratulations! You have successfully created your first collection into Bruno!

## Custom Collection Names

<Callout type="info">
  Starting with [Bruno v1.40.0 <strong><sup>↗</sup></strong>](https://www.usebruno.com/downloads), you can
  now use special characters in collection names and customize how they appear in
  the filesystem. This gives you more flexibility in organizing your collections
  while maintaining compatibility.
</Callout>

You can use any characters in your collection names, including special characters like `/`, `[`, `]`, `*`, etc. Bruno automatically handles filesystem compatibility by replacing unsupported characters with `-` in the filenames while preserving your original collection name.

[Add a request <strong><sup>↗</sup></strong>](https://docs.usebruno.com/get-started/bruno-basics/create-a-request) to your collection as a next step!
