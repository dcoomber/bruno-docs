## Custom Collection Names

<Callout type="info">
  Starting with [Bruno v1.40.0 <strong><sup>↗</sup></strong>](https://www.usebruno.com/downloads), you can
  now use special characters in collection names and customize how they appear in
  the filesystem.
</Callout>

You can use any characters in your collection names, including special characters like `/`, `[`, `]`, `*`, etc. Bruno automatically handles filesystem compatibility by replacing unsupported characters with `-` in the filenames while preserving your original collection name.

[Add a request <strong><sup>↗</sup></strong>](https://docs.usebruno.com/get-started/bruno-basics/create-a-request) to your collection as a next step!
