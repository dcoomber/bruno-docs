Your new folder is now ready to organize your requests!

## Custom Folder Names

<Callout type="info">
  Starting with [Bruno v1.40.0 <strong><sup>↗</sup></strong>](https://www.usebruno.com/downloads), you can
  now use special characters in folder names and customize how they appear in
  the filesystem.
</Callout>

You can use any characters in your folder names, including special characters like `/`, `[`, `]`, `*`, etc. Bruno automatically handles filesystem compatibility by replacing unsupported characters with `-` in the filenames while preserving your original folder name.

### How to View or Customize Filesystem Names

1. Select **Show Filesystem Name.**

3. (Optional) Click the edit icon to customize the filesystem name while keeping your display name intact.

This feature allows you to:

- Create more descriptive folder organization.
- Use special characters freely.
- Maintain filesystem compatibility automatically.
- Keep your collection structure clean and organized.

### Example

You could name a folder "API [v2.0] / Authentication" and Bruno will automatically handle the filesystem compatibility while preserving your desired display name.
