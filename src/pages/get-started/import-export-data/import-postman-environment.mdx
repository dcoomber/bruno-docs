# Import Postman Environment

Environments in API clients are sets of variables that allow you to run requests against different server configurations (development, staging, production) without changing your request URLs. 

## Exporting Environment from Postman

1. Open Postman and locate the **Environments** section in the sidebar (below Collections)
2. Find the environment you want to export
3. Click on the three dots (**...**) next to the environment name
4. Select **Export** from the dropdown menu
5. Choose a location to save the JSON file and click **Save**

6. Select the Postman environment JSON file you exported
7. The environment will be added to your existing environments

## Using Imported Environment Variables

After importing your Postman environment, you can use the variables in the same way you did in Postman:

```
{{variableName}}
```

For example:
- URL: `{{baseUrl}}/api/users`
- Headers: `Authorization: Bearer {{apiKey}}`
- Request Body: `{"client_id": "{{clientId}}"}`

## Switching Between Environments

To switch between different environments:

1. Click on the **Environments** dropdown in the top-right corner
2. Select the environment you want to use
3. All requests will now use the variables from the selected environment

With environments properly configured, your API requests will work seamlessly across different deployment environments without manual changes.
