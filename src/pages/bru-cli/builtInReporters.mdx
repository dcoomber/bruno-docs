# Generating Reports

Bruno CLI provides built-in support for generating reports in three formats: **JSON**, **JUnit**, and **HTML**. These reports help with analyzing test results and integrating with various CI/CD tools.

You can generate any combination of these reports and even run them simultaneously.

### JSON Report

To generate a report in JSON format, use the `--reporter-json` option:

```bash copy
bru run request.bru --reporter-json results.json
```

This will output the test results in a results.json file, which can be useful for further processing or programmatic analysis.

### JUnit Report

To generate a report in JUnit format, use the `--reporter-junit` option:

```bash copy
bru run request.bru --reporter-junit results.xml
```

The results.xml file will be in a format compatible with JUnit, making it ideal for integration with CI/CD pipelines that rely on JUnit reporting.


### HTML Report

To generate a human-readable HTML report, use the `--reporter-html` option:

```bash copy
bru run request.bru --reporter-html results.html
```

This will create an results.html file that provides a visual representation of the test outcomes, ideal for quick reviews.

### Running Multiple Reporters Simultaneously

You can generate multiple reports at once by specifying more than one reporter option. For example, to generate JSON, JUnit, and HTML reports simultaneously, run:

```bash copy
bru run request.bru --reporter-json results.json --reporter-junit results.xml --reporter-html results.html
```

This command will create three files: `results.json, results.xml, and results.html`, allowing you to analyze the results in different formats as needed.

## Skipping Specific Headers in the Report

If you want to exclude certain headers from the report, use the `--reporter-skip-headers` option. You can list multiple headers to skip, separated by spaces.

```bash
bru run --reporter-html results.html --reporter-skip-headers "Authorization" "X-Auth-Token"
```

## Skip All Headers in the Report

To exclude all headers from the report, use the `--reporter-skip-all-headers` option. This will remove all headers from the output report, ensuring a cleaner result.

```bash copy
bru run --reporter-html results.html --reporter-skip-all-headers
```
