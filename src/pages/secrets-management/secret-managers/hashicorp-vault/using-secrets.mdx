## Using Secrets in Request Fields

Secrets are accessed in the same way as collection and environment variables. The secrets can be accessed in headers, query, body, auth input fields similar to collection and environment variables.

Secrets need to be prefixed with `$secrets` followed by the `secret name` and then the `key name`, all separated by periods.

Pattern: `$secrets`.`<secret-name>`.`<key-name>`.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
The secret name is the “Name” field you set when configuring the AWS Secrets Manager provider in Bruno. The key name is the specific secret key within that AWS secret.
</Callout>

## Using Secrets in Scripts

You can also access secrets from within Pre-request and Post-request scripts using the `bru.getSecretVar()` function.

```javascript
const secretValue = bru.getSecretVar('<secret-name>.<key-name>');
console.log(secretValue); // This will log the value of your secret

// Example
const apiKey = bru.getSecretVar('payment-service.api-key');
req.setHeaders('x-api-key: ' + apiKey);
```

This approach keeps your sensitive data secure while allowing you to leverage it in your API automation scripts.
