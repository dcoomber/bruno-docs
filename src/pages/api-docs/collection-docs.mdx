# Document a Collection

Bruno allows you to add documentation directly at the collection level, which can be extremely useful for providing a high-level overview of your entire API collection.

By configuring documentation at the collection level, you ensure that users and developers have a centralized place to understand the key concepts, actions, and flow of your API before diving into individual requests or folders.

## Create Collection Docs

1. Go to the **Collection** and click on **More Options**.
2. Select **Settings** from the dropdown menu.
