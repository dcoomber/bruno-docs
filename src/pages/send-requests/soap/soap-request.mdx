# SOAP API request

Bruno enables you to make HTTP calls using Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), a messaging protocol used for exchanging structured information between systems over a network. SOAP defines a standard for request-response communication and is based on XML data format.

### Key Components of a SOAP Message

1. **Envelope**: The outermost element that defines the start and end of the message.
2. **Header**: (Optional) Contains meta-information or additional information about the message.
3. **Body**: The main part of the message that contains the actual data or the request/response payload

## Create SOAP request

1. Create new request inside a collection in Bruno.
2. Select **HTTP** and add URL and name.
3. Click on **Create** button.
