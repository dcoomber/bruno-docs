# Code Generator

Bruno makes it easy to generate code snippets from your API requests, allowing you to quickly integrate and test your API in various programming languages. This feature supports multiple languages (35+) and can help you save time when writing client code for your API.

## How Code Snippets Work in Bruno

Brunoâ€™s Code Snippet feature automatically generates the necessary code to make the same API request in various programming languages, such as **Python, JavaScript, cURL,** and others. This makes it easy to share and implement API calls directly into your application.
