# Bruno Starter Guide

Bruno offers a fast, Git-friendly approach to API development that's fundamentally different from traditional API clients. This comprehensive guide will take you from your first request to advanced automation through structured, hands-on learning.

## What You'll Learn

This guide provides a progressive learning path through 13 carefully designed challenges, each building on skills from previous sections. You'll master everything from basic requests to advanced automation and team collaboration.

## Prerequisites

To get the most from this guide, you should have:

- Basic understanding of HTTP and REST principles
- Familiarity with JSON data format
- Bruno installed on your system ([download here](https://www.usebruno.com/downloads))
- Git for version control challenges (optional)

## Getting Started

The Bruno Starter Guide is available on GitHub repository with hands-on challenges:

For the full hands-on experience, clone the official Bruno Starter Guide repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bruno-collections/bruno-starter-guide.git
```

This repository contains:
- Structured challenges
- Sample collections and requests
- Complete documentation for each challenge
- **Solution folders** with working examples for each challenge

Once cloned, open the collection in Bruno to start working through the challenges at your own pace.

## Challenge Path

Progress through these challenges to build your Bruno expertise step by step:

<Steps>
### 1. Bruno Basics

Learn the fundamentals of Bruno's interface and create your first API request. You'll understand Bruno's collection structure and send a simple GET request to a public API.

### 2. Environment and Collection Variables

Master Bruno's environment system to manage variables across different contexts (development, testing, production). Create and use collection-level and environment-level variables.

### 3. API Requests with Data

Learn to construct requests with different HTTP methods, headers, and body formats. Send structured data to APIs and understand content type specifications.

### 4. Response Handling and Debugging

Explore response data, status codes, and headers. Use Bruno's built-in debugging tools to troubleshoot request issues and understand API behaviors.

### 5. Authentication Methods

Implement common API authentication patterns including API keys, Basic Auth, and Bearer tokens. Secure your authentication credentials using environment variables.

### 6. Secret Management

Learn best practices for handling sensitive information in Bruno. Create and manage secure environment variables and integrate with .env files.

### 7. Request Scripting

Harness Bruno's powerful scripting capabilities to automate request preparation and response processing. Write JavaScript code that executes before and after requests.

### 8. Test Assertions

Build robust API tests with assertions. Write test scripts that validate response data, ensuring your APIs work as expected across different environments.

### 9. Collection Runner

Execute multiple requests in sequence with Bruno's collection runner. Create data files to power parameterized testing across your entire API collection.

### 10. API Documentation

Create clear, comprehensive documentation for your APIs using Bruno's markdown support. Learn documentation best practices that improve team collaboration.

### 11. Git Collaboration

Leverage Bruno's file-based approach for version control. Learn effective Git workflows for collaborating on API collections within development teams.

### 12. OpenAPI Integration

Import and export OpenAPI specifications. Convert between Bruno collections and industry-standard API definitions for ecosystem compatibility.

### 13. CLI Automation

Master Bruno's command-line interface for headless execution. Integrate API testing into CI/CD pipelines and automate collection runs.
