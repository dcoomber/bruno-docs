# Running Automated Tests

The [Bruno CLI](/bru-cli/overview) is a command line utliity that allows you to call tests from the terminal, or **integrate your test collections into a CI/CD pipeline**. 

Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) empower teams to ship software updates rapidly and reliably, maximizing user value without compromising quality. By integrating automated API tests into the build pipeline, you verify that every code change is validated and production-ready.

For more information on the Bruno CLI, go to that [specific section of the documentation](/bru-cli/overview).
