# Vars tab

The **Vars** tab in Bruno allows you to manage variables at different stages of your request lifecycle. You can set and use variables:
- Before the request (Pre Request)
- After receiving the response (Post Response)

<Callout type="info">
  Variables are scoped within the request and cannot be accessed outside of it. This ensures clean separation between different requests.
</Callout>

## Pre Request Vars

In the **Vars** tab > **Pre Request** variables section, you can write any strings, numbers or any valid JavaScript literal.

Example:

![bru vars](/screenshots/set-vars.webp)

## Post Response Vars

In the **Vars** tab > **Post Response** variables section, you can write any valid JavaScript expression. The `res` object is available, allowing you to declaratively parse the [response object](/testing/script/response/response-object) and set variables, instead of writing scripts to do the same.

Example:

![Screenshot showing how to use defined variables in the request body](/screenshots/vars.webp)

For parsing the response, you can checkout the [response query](/testing/script/response/response-query) that allows you to easily query your response.
